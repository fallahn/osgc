Desert Island Duel
------------------

A 1 - 4 player multplayer online game (with bots), Desert Island Duel pits four mighty pirates against each other in their search for treasure. Follow your map, dig in the sand and reap the booty! Sound simple? Don't count on it! Not only are there 3 other pirates awaiting to thwart your every move there are skeletons at night (thanks to the full day/night cycle), booby traps, bees, bad weather and more!

This game was originally developed with distribution through Valve's Steam platform in mind, and therefore requires agreement to Steam SDK license and the Steam API library installed to build. It also requires a valid Steam account and the Steam client installed to run. However, at the time of writing, this game should be compatible with all Steam platforms.
