    AudioSource components are use to play sounds within the scene.
    An AudioSource requires an AudioBuffer in the same way a sprite
    requires a texture - ie multiple AudioSource components may use
    the same AudioBuffer (and should when playing the same sound!).
    AudioSources which use mono sound buffers are generally panned
    according to their position in the world (assuming the parent
    entity also has a Transform component attached) but this can 
    depend on the platform and AudioRenderer in use.
