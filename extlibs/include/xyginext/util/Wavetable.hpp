            \brief Creates a vector containing a series of floating point values
            representing a single cycle of a sine wave.

            \param amplitude Amplitude of generated sine wave
            \param updateRate Rate at which the wave table is likely to be stepped through, normally
            the same rate at which the framework is updated (60hz)

            Sinewaves are useful for a variety of things, including dictating the motion of animated
            objects. Precalculating a wavetable is more efficient than repeatedly calling sin()
