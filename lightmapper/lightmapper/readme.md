This lightmapper application is based on the example at https://github.com/ands/lightmapper . As there's no license apparently attached to the example and the lightmapper itself is public domain, this application has no real license to it either - do what you will with it, just don't hold me liable if it breaks something...

The purpose of the application is to render lightmaps used in Bob's Big Adventure (an [OSGC](https://github.com/fallahn/osgc) plugin) so I doubt it's much use to anyone other than reference anyway, assuming someone wants an example of how to mash together C++17 with C99.

Building the application requires only glfw3.3 installed if not using the included Visual Studio solution, else all dependencies are included in the repository. A big thanks goes to ands for his fantastic lightmapper, and for making it public domain!
