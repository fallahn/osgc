Back To Computer!
-----------------

Journey back in time and travel through the landscapes of a multitude of retro inspired platformers. Back To Computer is an open ended story about a retro console engineer trying to find their way back home through a maze of old and, in some cases, half repaired computer systems...

All maps are created in [Tiled](http://mapeditor.org) and contributions of new maps are welcome! See the map directory for more details on creating levels for the game.

Back To Computer is made possible by the open source contributions of artists at [Open Game Art](http://opengameart.org), for a complete list of credits see the `assets` directory.
